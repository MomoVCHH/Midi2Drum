If you don’t have the VR Game program, you have to download it. 
( https://store.steampowered.com/app/677060/Into_the_Rhythm_VR/ )

1.
Go to the GitHub Project “Midi2Drum” ( https://github.com/MomoVCHH/Midi2Drum ),and download or clone it. 
If you download it then you have to extract it. 

2.
Now double click to open the folder “Midi2Drum-master. ” And then open the src folder and double-click the file “ create_bin.bat” to compile the Java Source code the gameFiles folder. 

3.
Go to folder “gameFiles”, and copy all files and folders to your installation path of Into The Rhythm VR.   (for me it is the path: “C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Into the Rhythm”.

4.
Download the TiMidity++-2.14.0. ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity/ )  and copy the folder TiMidity++-2.14.0 into the dependencies folder (“C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Into the Rhythm\dependencies” ). Then go to the folder ” Into the Rhythm” and double-click the file”Midi2DrumUI.bat” to start the Java program.You will get the User Interface which allows you to convert a MIDI File with drums into the format needed for the game.

5.
Now you load the MIDI file and optional an image as the album-cover into the program. Type the wished song title (<YourSongTitle>) and artist name, choose a difficulty and optional make other settings. You can also press the play button to hear the MIDI Music to test your file. After done all the settings you can finally export the files (this could last longer than 1 minute). The Drum Instrument (which has always the MIDI Channel 10) will be translated to the ITR format for the gameplay. Timidity is used to create a wav File for the Backgroundmusic (BGM) and every single tone of the drums (“C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Into the Rhythm\Editor\Note Sound\CustermorNoteSound\<YourSongTitle>)
 
6.
Now you have automatically all the exported files in the subfolders of the folder “Editor” and you can directly use it in your gameplay. (The subfolder names of the Editor folder for the generated files are: Image, BGM, ITR  and \Note Sound\CustermorNoteSound\<YourSongTitle>)

If you open the subfolder CustomNoteSound, you have all the single wav files for the each tone of the drum kit in the folder for the song (they were also generated out of the MIDI File) 

7.
Now open the VR Game “Into The Rhythm VR”. There are some options, choose the option “GAME START” and hit the drum “ok”.  And them choose the option “Play Custom”. There you will find the newly generated songs. 

Now you can see your project on the menu.  Enjoy it !
